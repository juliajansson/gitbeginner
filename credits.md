Credits to:
* Ben Lippmeier who created the gloss package.
* Chris Smith who wrote two tutorials that have been very helpful "Haskell For Kids" and "Graphical Haskell for Beginners".
* Patrik Jansson for being a helpful teacher and author of much of the content.
* Me, for obvious reasons.
* The participants for participating and giving feedback in the course.
