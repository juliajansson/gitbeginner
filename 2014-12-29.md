#2015-01-01: About the course
In this course we are going to learn from each other. We are also going to learn from different online tutorials. I guess we will try to put together a course together. There will be much focus on understanding, explaining and trying. So dad will explain stuff of course. But also I will try to explain stuff. And if you find something that you know that I don't then you can explain that for the group. So it will be more like a programming circle then a course. We will show each other things that we make also. 

The programming language is going to be haskell. It's because I and my dad have some background in Haskell and because it's a functional programming language.If you have programmed in another language or that you want to learn another language, we can put some time for that too but then you are responsible for it.

It would be helpful if you could tell me your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris etc). Both I and Patrik has Linux.  Be aware that you may not get help with installing things on platforms Mac or Windows, but there are a bunch of tutorials on the internet so you can follow them. 

We will start out with a library called Gloss to our help. In libraries there are pieces of programs that other people have already written so we won't have to start everything from scratch.

Github is the main online site where you share programs in the programming world. There's a lot of open source code. It's helpful to see other programs and try to run them and see what happens. I recommend you to create an account and put your programs up there. But it's hard to start on Github on your own. We will probably go through it, but there is also a lot of tutorials on https://help.github.com

So preparations:
* Look up if the time 2-4 pm GMT time works.
* Install a simple text editor (whatever you want to or recomended Emacs)

Contact me if you have questions or any problems and we will try to solve them. 
# 2014-12-29: Github stuff:
Create an account, I hope that part won't be too hard. Make sure to "follow" juliajansson and patrikja. 
Useful links for just starting at github:

# 2014-12-27: Some background, history, core concepts and the first few programs

Programming languages can be classified in different groups called "programming paradigms":

* imperative programming: Fortran, C, Cobol, Assembly
* objectoriented programming: Java, C#, C++, Objective C, 
* functional programming: Haskell, JavaScript, ML, Erlang, Scheme, Lisp
* logic programming: Prolog
* scripting languages: PHP, shell, Perl

Language popularity: http://langpop.com/

Early programming languages include:

* Fortran: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran
* Lisp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)

----------------

Important concepts:

* a program is a precise description of something you want the computer to compute(;-)
    * a program can have several forms: source code, machine code, etc.
    * source code is a human-readable (text) form of a program
    * machine code is a CPU-readable (binary) form of a program
* a CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core of a computer
    * the CPU can only run programs in binary "machine code" form (unreadable for humans)
* a compiler is a translator from source code to (some form of) machine code

----------------

We start out with simple examples inspired by Jan Skansholm's book [Java - steg f√∂r steg](http://skansholm.com/javasteg/):

* [Hej](https://github.com/patrikja/javabeginner/blob/master/javamapp/Hej.java)
* [Callme](https://github.com/patrikja/javabeginner/blob/master/javamapp/Callme.java)

A promising-looking Java tutorial:

* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm

and some simple examples in Haskell:

* [Haskell](https://github.com/juliajansson/haskellbeginner)

and perhaps this series of blog posts

* [Haskell for kids](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/haskell-for-kids-week-1/)
