#2015-01-01: About the course
The course sessions ("e-meetings") will be held roughly every second Saturday at 2-4 pm [UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html). I will always tell you when the next session is at least 4 days before. Sometimes you may get homework. Or more like "try this if you want to". It's never required and I understand if you have a lot in school that particular week. But the "homework" will probably help you in moving forward in programming.

In this course we are going to learn from each other and from different online tutorials. But we will also produce our own learning material - you can think of it as putting a course together. The focus will be on understanding, explaining and trying. My dad [Patrik Jansson](https://github.com/patrikja) will be available to explain stuff when we need more depth (he is doing research and teaching programming at [Chalmers](www.chalmers.se)). But also [I](https://github.com/juliajansson) will try to explain stuff. And if you find something that you want to share you can explain it to the group. So in effect it will be more like a programming [study circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_circle) then a course. We will show each other things that we make also.

Examples of homework is:
* Write a program that can compute X. (Where X could be a mathematical function, some graphics or a text in [Rövarspråket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6varspr%C3%A5ket).)
* Read about some piece of programming and exlpain it to us the next lesson. Since it's a programming circle we all try to teach each other.
* Try and practice a concept until you feel that you understand.

The programming language is going to be [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/). It's because I and my dad have some background in Haskell and because it's a functional programming language. If you have programmed in another language or that you want to learn another language, we can put aside some time for that too but then you are responsible for it.

It would be helpful if you could tell me your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris etc). Both I and Patrik use Linux. Be aware that you may not get help from us with installing things on other platforms like Mac or Windows, but there are a bunch of tutorials on the internet so you can follow them.

We will start out using a library called [Gloss](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/) for simple vector graphics (lines, circles, etc.). A library is a collection of pieces of programs that other people have already written so we won't have to start everything from scratch. (We may also contribute some simple library code by the end of the code for others to use!)

So preparations:
* Check if the time 2-4 pm UCT works.
* Make sure you have skype access (for audio + chat during the lessons).
* You also need a internet-connected computer with a keyboard. 

Use [this e-mail list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellbeginner) (haskellbeginner@gmail.com) if you have questions or any problems and we will try to solve them. Or you could contact me (Julia).

TIPS (If you happen to have some time):
* http://progolymp.se/traning/uppgifter There are a lot of (kind of hard) tasks at the swedish programming olympiad. Unfortunately they are only in swedish.
* Registrate on Kattis ( https://po.kattis.com/problems ). This is alo Swedish.
* A great tutorial site https://www.fpcomplete.com/school .
 
# 2014-12-29: Github stuff:
Github is the main online site where you share programs in the programming world. It contains millions of lines of [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) code. It's helpful to see other programs and try to run + modify them and see what happens. I recommend you to create an account and put your programs up there. But it may be hard to start on Github on your own. We will probably go through it, but there is also a lot of tutorials on https://help.github.com.

Create an account, I hope that part won't be too hard. Make sure to "follow" juliajansson and patrikja.

# 2014-12-27: Some background, history, core concepts and the first few programs

Programming languages can be classified in different groups called "programming paradigms":

* imperative programming: Fortran, C, Cobol, Assembly
* objectoriented programming: Java, C#, C++, Objective C, 
* functional programming: Haskell, JavaScript, ML, Erlang, Scheme, Lisp
* logic programming: Prolog
* scripting languages: PHP, shell, Perl

Language popularity: http://langpop.com/

Early programming languages include:

* Fortran: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran
* Lisp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)

----------------

Important concepts:

* a program is a precise description of something you want the computer to compute(;-)
    * a program can have several forms: source code, machine code, etc.
    * source code is a human-readable (text) form of a program
    * machine code is a CPU-readable (binary) form of a program
* a CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core of a computer
    * the CPU can only run programs in binary "machine code" form (unreadable for humans)
* a compiler is a translator from source code to (some form of) machine code

----------------

We start out with simple examples inspired by Jan Skansholm's book [Java - steg för steg](http://skansholm.com/javasteg/):

* [Hej](https://github.com/patrikja/javabeginner/blob/master/javamapp/Hej.java)
* [Callme](https://github.com/patrikja/javabeginner/blob/master/javamapp/Callme.java)

A promising-looking Java tutorial:

* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm

and some simple examples in Haskell:

* [Haskell](https://github.com/juliajansson/haskellbeginner)

and perhaps this series of blog posts

* [Haskell for kids](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/haskell-for-kids-week-1/)
